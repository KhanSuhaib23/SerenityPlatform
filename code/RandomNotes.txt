So in rendering the part of my platform takes 0.11ms
And total takes around 1.7ms

My memset takes 9 times as much time as c memset

Now with varities of MemSet i am only 1.5 times slower. 
They prbably use assembly to make it faster


windowHandle using 
internal int32 __SerenityGetWindowIndexFromHandle(HWND windowHandle)
probably has cache misses

Performance Avg Time 0.000075ms Called n times.

again SOA can help see even if it matters

porbably doesn't messages that take place 1 per frame dont even go there.
and the time is same enough

In the callback width and height are used after the bmi header so see if cache locality can help
prolly not cause it is WM_SIZE doesn;t happen often enouygh

Get Free Slot has same problem as IndexFromHandle SOA will help but prolly not called often enough to warrant a code change

Serenity Input Update using my own memset could and should be imprived to be better than c memset

Application Should Close same as IndexFrtomHandle SOA may solve called more often so can be helpful (0.000023 before SOA)

App should close does benefit from SOA (by like 0.000006ms) so??????
